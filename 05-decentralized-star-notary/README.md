Credits for resources that helped me finish the project:

- [ibrunotome](https://github.com/ibrunotome/udacity-blockchain-developer-nanodegree/tree/master/project4) from github, whose implementation of this project guided me along the way. I used some of ibrunotome's code as helper code especially with using express.js framework concepts.
